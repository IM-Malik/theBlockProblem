# theBlockProblem
You must write a recursive method, that will count the
number of ways to throw bricks. Consider a construction site worker who manually
unload bricks from the truck. The worker has three options depending on his fatigue level
to pick brick from truck and throw it on the ground:
  1. Throw one brick at a time
  2. Throw two bricks at a time
  3. Throw three bricks at a time

You need to calculate how many different ways the worker can throw the bricks using the
three options (trow one brick at a time, two bricks at a time, or three bricks at a time).

-Example 1:
  Command: bricksToUnload 1
  Output: 1

-Example 2:
  Command: bricksToUnload 2
  Output: 2

-Example 3:
  Command: bricksToUnload 3
  Output: 4
